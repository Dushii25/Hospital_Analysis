# Hospital Emergency Dashboard

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing emergency department data to create a **Hospital Emergency Dashboard**. The goal is to visualize key metrics related to patient flow, resource utilization, and emergency case trends to enhance decision-making in hospital management.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes records of:
- Patient demographics (age, gender, location)
- Emergency admission details (time of arrival, triage level)
- Treatment and discharge status
- Bed occupancy and wait times
- Critical cases and response time

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor emergency room occupancy rates
- Identify peak hours and patient influx patterns
- Analyze wait times and treatment efficiency
- Track common emergency cases and critical incidents
- Provide real-time insights for hospital administration

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL** (for data querying and preprocessing)
- **Tableau/Power BI** (for interactive visualizations)


## 📈 Key Insights
- **Peak emergency hours** observed.
- **High patient wait times** during weekends and holidays.
- **Triage cases** (critical patients) require faster response.
